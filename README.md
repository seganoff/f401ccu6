## playing around with blackpill from AZ-delivery, 
accompanied with ve3wwg stm book.

other usefull books by cnoviello > todo: list all mentioned stm documentations
PacktPublishing/Hands-On-RTOS-with-Microcontrollers > even uses nucleo f767zi,
but freaking combination: license level 0 of j-link + switching back to st-link under pinche Win only
possible solution: turn bluepill into st-link & leave jlink on nucleo

## include macros, too many, really all needed, especially if i dont wanna use libwwg
ll /opt/gcc-arm/arm-none-eabi/include/ #included <headers.h>
