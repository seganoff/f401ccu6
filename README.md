## playing around with blackpill from AZ-delivery, 
accompanied with ve3wwg stm book.

other usefull books: 

by cnoviello > todo: list all mentioned stm documentations

PacktPublishing/Hands-On-RTOS-with-Microcontrollers > even uses nucleo f767zi,
but freaking combination: license level 0 of j-link + switching back to st-link under pinche Win only
possible solution: turn bluepill into st-link & leave jlink on nucleo

hexagon5un > 8-bit avr, but excellent explainations and cool ideas from Elliot Williams.
I would strongly suggest starting your microcontroller's journey from here, if your totaly new to the topic.
The one & only time me started ardIDE: to flash "ArduinoAsISP" sketch.
(ok, gonna use it once more to do the HighVoltage revive attempt of that qfp32 168, resoldered to a breakout from unknown clone)
